## My process

### Built with

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

Start with our inputs. I use number input for this and it came with arrows. I removed it with this CSS code:

```css
.input-field input {
	appearance: none;
	-moz-appearance: textfield;
}
```

Then, I ran into another problem: I cannot limit digits for my input. That only works for text. So this is another piece of code I found:

```html
<input oninput="this.value=this.value.slice(0,this.maxLength)" maxlength="2" />
```

The main gist is the function inside `oninput`. Essentially, it will receive the value we put in and use `slice()` to, well, slice any excess digits according to our `maxlength` value.

I did have a lot to take in when it comes to JavaScript. So, I looked into [another person's solution](https://github.com/Syfrost/Age-calculator-app-FM) I find in frontendmentor.io. I use most of the code in his script and adjust here and there to my liking. It makes so much sense.
